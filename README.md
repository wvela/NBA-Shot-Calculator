# NBA-Shot-Calculator
Final project for Intro to Machine Learning

This is my final project for Intro to Machine Learning, worked on by Walker Vela and Matthias Mcfarelane.

This project will take a given X,Y location on a basketball court and determine the chance each player on the given team has to make the shot. 
This is done in two different methods:
  1. Using K Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  2. Using a Neural Network (NN)
Each method is trained using 80% of the shots players took in a season and then tested on the remaing 20% of the players shots.
The method with the highest accuracy is then used to determine each players chance of making the shot at the input X,Y location. 
From there the player with the highest chance will have a shot chart printed with all shots from one season and a marker at the given X,Y location. ![Results](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28545417/144792733-9856eefb-748e-4e08-b312-1d334ebc9b7c.PNG)
